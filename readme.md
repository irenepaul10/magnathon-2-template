Focusing on the track "Responsible Consumption and Production".
 (a) Title of the idea Proposal: Intelligent Wate Sorting Machine 
(b) Branch / Subject area: Control System, Machine Learning
(c) idea Type (Developmental/Demonstration/Others): Developmental
Abstract: In response to the escalating global waste crisis, there's an urgent demand for innovative solutions that not only address environmental concerns but also foster sustainable development. This idea presents an Intelligent Waste Sorting System, utilizing advanced logo recognition technology to augment waste segregation efficiency. Its primary goal is to mitigate contamination in waste streams, advocating for recycling and minimizing environmental impact. At the idea's core lies the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision techniques for recognizing logos on consumer packaging. Employing cutting-edge algorithms enables the system to accurately identify and categorize waste items based on their brand logos.
	A pivotal aspect of this idea is the incorporation of carbon credit calculation to generate income. The system evaluates the environmental footprint of the sorted waste and computes the carbon credits associated with the recycling process. These credits can be traded on the carbon market, establishing a revenue stream that not only sustains the idea but also incentivizes businesses to adopt eco-friendly packaging practices. This initiative not only contributes to the global endeavor to combat the waste crisis but also aligns with climate change mitigation strategies through the generation of carbon credits. The combination of intelligent waste sorting and carbon credit income offers a holistic approach towards creating a greener and economically viable waste management paradigm. By introducing state-of-the-art technologies and innovative financial incentives, the idea aims to redefine waste management practices, setting a precedent for sustainable solutions. 
	The integration of AI and computer vision not only addresses the immediate need for efficient waste sorting but also positions the idea as a pioneering force in the intersection of technology and environmental sustainability. As the idea envisions a future where waste management is both ecologically responsible and economically viable, it stands as a testament to the potential of technology-driven solutions in mitigating the global waste crisis. In fostering a symbiotic relationship between environmental conservation and financial viability, this Intelligent Waste Sorting System represents a significant step towards a greener and more sustainable future.

## How it Works ?
Explaining the working of project
Certainly! Here's the updated explanation with the addition of the real-time web app:

The Intelligent Waste Sorting System utilizes a combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision techniques to efficiently sort waste based on brand logos. Here's how it works:

1. **Image Capture:** The system is equipped with a camera that captures images of waste items as they are fed into the sorting machine.

2. **Logo Recognition:** The captured images are then processed using a deep learning model called MobileNet, which is optimized for mobile and embedded devices. MobileNet is trained on a large dataset of images containing various brand logos.

3. **TensorFlow Lite Integration:** TensorFlow Lite, a lightweight version of TensorFlow optimized for mobile and embedded devices, is used to deploy the MobileNet model on the sorting machine. This allows for real-time inference on the captured images directly on the device, without the need for a powerful external server.

4. **Image Classification:** The MobileNet model analyzes the captured images and identifies any brand logos present on the waste items. It classifies the items into different categories based on the recognized logos.

5. **Waste Segregation:** Based on the classification results, the system segregates the waste items into different bins designated for recyclable and non-recyclable materials.

6. **Real-Time Web App:** Additionally, a real-time web application is integrated into the system to provide a user-friendly interface for monitoring and managing the sorting process. This web app displays real-time data on the number of bottles segregated, recycling rates, and carbon credit generation.

7. **Carbon Credit Calculation:** In addition to waste sorting, the system incorporates carbon credit calculation functionality. It evaluates the environmental footprint of the sorted waste and computes the carbon credits associated with the recycling process.

8. **Revenue Generation:** The calculated carbon credits can be traded on the carbon market, generating income for the system. This revenue stream helps sustain the project and incentivizes businesses to adopt eco-friendly packaging practices.

Overall, by leveraging MobileNet and TensorFlow Lite for logo recognition and waste sorting, and incorporating a real-time web app for data visualization, the Intelligent Waste Sorting System offers an innovative and holistic approach to waste management. It not only promotes recycling and environmental conservation but also generates revenue through carbon credit trading, contributing to a greener and more sustainable future.
